# Signup Form 

This is a part of the coding challenge which I had to complete.

### Objective

Using TypeScript and React, your assignment is to implement a responsive signup form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Features

- When missing required info, each field throws an error.
- When email is invalid, it shows a sample email in the placeholder.
- password must be at least 8 characters long, and contains both numbers and english alphabet characters
